Functional visualization of the set of components in a server-client system running a certain application.
 The client will be a certain information application that includes several pages that will be managed in the SPA architecture.
 The communication between the client and the server will be carried out by simulating the communication mechanisms of JavaScript.
 The server simulation will receive requests from a client and will use the simulation of a local database to handle the information.
